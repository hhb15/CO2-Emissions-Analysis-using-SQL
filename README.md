# CO2-Emissions-Analysis-using-SQL

In this project, I worked with a dataset on CO2 emissions across different sectors. I designed and implemented the database schema using SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) to create tables and establish relationships between them. The dataset was then populated using SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands.

I also wrote complex SQL queries to extract insights from the data. Key analyses included identifying sectors with the highest emissions, comparing emission trends over time, and answering specific questions related to regional emission levels.
