/* Part 3 -- Extending Queries on Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky*/

/* Showcasing total CO2 emissions, deaths, and population for Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, and New Jersey 
	 from the years of 2012 to 2021 for easier comparison between the four.
	 *
	 *
	 Managerial Insights:
	 From the four states, the highest co2 emissions across the years of 2012 to 2021 are from Kentucky. 
	 Kentucky also has the highest number of deaths compared to the other three states.
	 According to solarpower.guide, Kentucky is ranked 8th amongst all the states in the U.S for annual co2 emissions per capita.
	 Compared to Iowa, Kansas, and Kentucky, the state of NJ is the second highest in co2 emissions from 2012 to 2021.
	 *
	 Managerial Recommendations:
	 The state of Kentucky has the highest co2 emissions compared to Iowa, Kansas, and New Jersey. They also have the highest number of deaths
	 resulting from respiratory issues. It is important for more research to be done to investigate whether the respiratory deaths result from the co2 emissions 
	 and what can be done to reduce the number of deaths. There should be stricter rules and more regulatory compliance when it comes to co2 emissions.
	 The states should implement strategies to reduce co2 emissions based on each sector, especially the sectors where co2 emissions are highest in each state.

	 *
	 *
	 Managerial Insights:
	 In Iowa, it seems that the highest co2 emissions are from the electric power sector.
	 In Kansas, the highest co2 emissions are mostly from the electric power sector as well.
	 In Kentucky, the highest co2 emissions are from the electric power sector, with transportation being a close second.
	 In New Jersey, the highest co2 emissions result from the transportation sector.
	 The sector that is mostly producing the highest co2 emissions is the electric power sector.
	 *
	 Managerial Recommendations: 
	 In Iowa, Kansas, and Kentucky, the highest co2 emissions resulted from the electric power sector. To reduce these emissions, it is important for these states to
	 change their policies and invest in new technologies. They should switch to more renewable energy sources and create long-term plans to keep co2 emissions
	 from the electric power sector to a minimum. Kentucky as a lot of emissions from coal so switching to a more renewable energy source would be incredibly
	 beneficial. 
	 As for New Jersey, their highest co2 emissions result from transportation. It would be important for them to switch to electric vehicles or invest in infrastructure
	 of other modes of transportation such as walking or biking.

	 Managerial Insights:
	 In Iowa, 2012 was the year that co2 emissions from electric power sector were the highest, however, the deaths were relatively low that year.
	 In Kansas, 2013 was the year that co2 emissions were highest from electric power.
	 In Kentucky, 2012 was the year that co2 emissions from electric power were the highest.
	 In New Jersey, 2015 was the year that co2 emissions from electric power were the highest.
	 Overall, co2 emissions from electric power were generally higher in 2012 and 2013 for all four of these states and would taper down as the years went on.
	 *
	 Managerial Recommendations:
	 From this table, it is shown how the co2 emissions from the electric power sector were the highest more than a decade ago, in 2012-2013. Ever since then, the co2 
	 emissions from this sector have been dropping, although they are still quite high. It is important that these states keep reducing the emissions resulting
	 from the electric power sector by sticking to long-term plans, so the emissions don't go back up the level that they were in 2012-2013.

/* Showing the percentage of co2 emissions from each fuel type in the states from the years of 2012 to 2021
	* 
	*
	Managerial Insights: 
	In Iowa, the percentage of co2 from each fuel type varied in each year. However, the highest percentages were generally from coal.
	In Kansas, the highest percentage was generally from coal as well, but petroleum was a very close second.
	In Kentucky, the highest percentage was coal. Kentucky is the fifth largest coal producing state in the U.S. and its highest percentage of co2 emissions resulted from coal. 
	In New Jersey, coal was the lowest percentage, while petroleum was the highest percentage. This makes sense as the transportation sector was 
	where the highest emissions came from in NJ.
	*
	Managerial Recommendations: 
	For the states that have large co2 emissions from coal, especially Kentucky, need to implement more regulatory measures to ensure that coal production 
	complies with environmental standards. They should be more strict about the co2 emissions and enforce punishments if rules aren't followed properly.
	Iowa, Kansas, and Kentucky should also invest in renewable energy sources to limit their coal production. There could be incentives to transition to a more
	renewable energy source other than coal. 
	The state of New Jersey had the highest co2 emissions from petroleum, which made sense because the transportation sector was where the highest co2 emissions 
	resulted from for NJ. While it may be difficult to reduce co2 emissions resulting from petroleum and transportation, there may be ways to do so. NJ should 
	invest in more public transportation and promote electric vehicles. There should also be regulation of vehicle emissions.
